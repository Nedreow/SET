# SET!
SET! is a cardgame where players rush to find and collect sets of cards from a grid of 12 cards on the table. I have started this project as part of my 100 days of code with the goal of improving my programming and C# skills.

The project uses [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) Mono version.
